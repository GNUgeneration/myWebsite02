    <h1>The Road Not Taken, by Robert Frost</h1>
    <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood
      and sorry I could not travel both
      and be one traveler long I stood
      and looked down one as far as I could
      to where it bent around the undergrowth.

      Then took the other as just as fair
      and having perhaps the better claim
      as it was grassy and wanted wear
      though as for that the passing there
      had worn them really about the same.

      And both that morning equally lay
      in leaves no step had troden black
      Oh, I kept the first for another day!
      yet knowing how way leads on to way
      I doubted if I should ever come back.

      I shall be telling this with a sigh
      somewhere ages and ages hence
      two roads diverged in a wood
      and I -- I took the one less traveled by
      and that has made all the difference.</p>
